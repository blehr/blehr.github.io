<p class="lead">I'm Brandon Lehr and I like to build things.</p>

<p>When I was young, I would tear apart my toys to see how they worked. Now that I'm older, I put that curiosity to good use to do things like work on my car, learn programming languages, and create web apps. Same idea, just more expensive toys!</p>

<p>I've spent most of my time learning the usual HTML and CSS, JavaScript and a few of the frameworks, as well as some node for the back-end.</p>
