# Unsubscribing from Firestore Realtime updates in React

<img src="/images/firestore_logo.png" class="img-md img-center"  alt="firestore logo">


I recently built [Roll Call](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brandonlehr.rollcall) my attendance taking Android app utilizing Firestore as my database. When I went to build the companion [web app](https://brandonlehr.com/rollcall) with React and Redux, I was faced with the issue of how to unsubscribe from the realtime updates when I was finished with them. Every good developer guards against memory leaks 😃 !

## The Problem

Unsubscribing is easy as you can see here from the official docs.

    var unsubscribe = db.collection("cities")
        .onSnapshot(function () {});
    // ...
    // Stop listening to changes
    unsubscribe();


The problem I was encountering was with the integration with React and Redux. My flow was as follows.

    📁 component (componentDidMount, onChange) -> 
    📁 action creators (subscribe to realtime updates) ->
    📁 reducers 

Getting the unsubscribe function to the component was easy enough. I just returned it from the action creator.

    export const getAllSubGroups = (userId, topLevelDocId) => dispatch => {
      const unsubscribe = db
        .collection("sub_group")
        .where("userId", "==", userId)
        .where("topLevelDocId", "==", topLevelDocId)
        .onSnapshot(querySnapshot => {
          dispatch({
            type: GET_SUB_GROUPS,
            payload: querySnapshot.docs
          });
        });
      return unsubscribe;
    };


Then I could access it in the calling method in the component. Here it is a select element with an onChange handler.

    handleChange = e => {
      const { value } = e.target;
      const { user } = this.props;
      if (value !== "") {
        const unsubscribe = this.props.getAllSubGroups(user.uid, value);
      }
    };

Now I have the unsubscribe in the handleChange method, but how to get it into componentWillUnmount? For this I removed the `const` and attached the unsubscribe to `this` making it available to the component.

    handleChange = e => {
      const { value } = e.target;
      const { user } = this.props;
      if (value !== "") {
        this.unsubscribe = this.props.getAllSubGroups(user.uid, value);
      }
    };

Now it can called in the componentWillUnmount lifecycle.

    componentWillUnmount = () => {
      // First check that it exists
      this.unsubscribe && this.unsubscribe();
    };

Since this method is a select onChange handler, the Firestore could be subscribed to multiple times with different queries. So now we can check for the existence of a previous unsubscribe and cancel it before subscribing to a new query.

    handleChange = e => {
      const { value } = e.target;
      const { user } = this.props;
      if (value !== "") {
        this.unsubscribe && this.unsubscribe();
        this.unsubscribe = this.props.getAllSubGroups(user.uid, value);
      }
    };

This approach has been working well for me. Let me know if you have found a better solution.
