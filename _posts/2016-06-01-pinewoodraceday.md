Looking for a no-cost solution for running pinewood derby and raingutter regatta races?

## PinewoodRaceDay

[PinewoodRaceDay](http://pinewoodraceday.com) is a single page app built with react.js and redux, capable of coordinating your group&#8217;s races with ease.

The entire app works offline after the initial page load, and all of the data is stored in [localForage](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage). This is perfect for Pack meeting places like mine, lacking WiFi or good cellular signal.

## Nothing to Download, Nothing to Install

Not everyone has the latest and greatest computer and then there is Windows, Mac, Linux, and Chrome OS. PinewoodRaceDay is available online and accessible from any browser on any platform, eliminating the need for specialized equipment.

## Elapsed-time or Points

Our pack is blessed to have a nice pinewood derby track with precision timers, but the software was problematic and eventually disappeared altogether. PinewoodRaceDay solves our problem by providing an easy to use interface for entering times and calculating averages and sorting by fastest times.

I wanted this solution to work as widely as possible, supporting tracks without timers as well as raingutter regatta races. To achieve this, there is a setting on the preferences page that allows converting to a points method. Everything works the same, just with entering scores from 1 to 4 for each heat, which will be totaled with the lowest score being the fastest.
