## Why did you leave WordPress?

WordPress is great. I recommend it for almost everything. That being said, I love to play with new things. I had heard of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator, and its integration with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and thought I'd try it out.

## Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator written in Ruby. Posts are written in markdown and transformed into static HTML. It's a blogging platform without a database! All your content is contained in files on your computer or pushed to GitHub. Nothing to lose or maintain!
